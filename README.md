# Linear-Regression
During my Machine Learning Class I was given the opportunity to experient with Linear Regression. I worked with the hyperparameters and was able to fit data without overfitting or uderfitting to a linear curve. Furthermore I worked with nonlinear parameters to fit nonlinear data to a nonlinear curve.
